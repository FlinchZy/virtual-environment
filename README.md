# Description
Since about 2010, the project for a portable development environment
exists as a portable platform for Windows. Based on a virtual hard disk,
the environment can be started easily and provides developers with a
completely preconfigured development environment with numerous tools,
services and programs and standardizes the tool set in a developer team.
Short setup times, uniform tools with uniform configuration, uniform
paths in the file system, central maintenance and simple distribution
and update are some of the advantages. The platform is easy to customize
and can be quickly changed for different projects and easily transferred
to other computers where started work is just continued.
