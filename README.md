# Description

Since about 2010, the project exists for a modular platform for Windows to
create portable development environments. Based on a virtual drive, the
environment can be started easily and provides developers with a completely
preconfigured development environment with numerous tools, services and
programs and standardizes the toolset in a development team. Short setup times,
uniform tools with uniform configuration, uniform paths in the file system,
centralized maintenance and easy distribution and updating are some of the
benefits. The platform is easily customizable, can be quickly switched to use
for different projects, and the environment can be easily transferred to other
machines where work started can be easily continued.

This project provides the environment with the necessary tools. The programs,
tools and services are not included but for many there are ready-made
configurations and automated helpers so that they can be easily loaded from the
Internet and integrated.

Complete environments can be several gigabytes in size and not all  tools,
programs and services are always needed and so everyone can decide for
themselves and customize the environment.

From my own experience from large companies with strict use of BitLocker, this
is also supported :-)

__Project is in development.__
