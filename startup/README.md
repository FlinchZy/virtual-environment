#Startup
Startup is a simple background launcher for batch scripts. The program expects
a batch file of the same name with the file extension cmd in the current
working directory or in the program directory. This script is then started with
a minimized console window. The program then wait until the end of the batch
script. If the startup program is renamed, this also affects the name of the
expected batch script.
