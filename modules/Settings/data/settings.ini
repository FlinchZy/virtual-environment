# Settings are a part of the startup of the virtual environment.
#
# The virtual environment file system is fully configured after creation.
# Settings are an optional extension to further personalize this configuration.
# For this purpose, this file contains key-value pairs and a list of files in
# which the placeholders corresponding to the keys are replaced with each
# startup.
#
# Settings are based on an ini file with two sections: SETTINGS and FILES.
#
# The section SETTINGS provides the keys and values for the placeholder
# replacement. The values can also already contain placeholders from preceding
# keys or environment variables. Keys start with a letter or underscore, then
# can be followed by alphanumeric characters, minus, underscore and dot, and
# end alphanumerically or with an underscore. Key and values are separated by a
# space, colon or equal sign.
#
# The section FILES is a list of files in which the placeholders are to be
# replaced. The paths must start with a slash or backslash. Drives at the
# beginning of the path are not supported, because the program always uses the
# drive where it is executed.
#
# Basically, sections, keys and placeholders are case-insensitive.
#
# The values of the placeholders come from the settings or from the environment
# variable. The notation of the placeholders is the same in both cases.
#
# The settings are implemented in such a way that the program can be started
# with new values at any time. To ensure that the change still works after the
# first replacement, the program creates reusable copies of the files as
# templates (end with settings), where the placeholders still remain included.
# If there is no template or the template is older than the original, then a
# new template is created.
#
# Only known placeholders are replaced, unknown ones remain.
