# Settings are a part of the initial startup of the virtual environment.
#
# The file system of the virtual environment is completely configured after
# creation. Settings are an optional extension to further personalize this
# configuration. For this purpose, this file contains key-value pairs with a
# list of files in which the corresponding fully qualified placeholders are
# replaced, which is executed each time the virtual environment is started.
#
# Because only keys with a value are replaced, this file can be prepared with
# the creation of the virtual environment. The user enters his personal data
# and the specified files are personalized with the next start of the virtual
# environment.
#
# Settings supports two types of variables and placeholders in this file and
# the destination files that are resolved with the start of the virtual
# environment. Environment variables $[...] and application variables #[...].
# Application variables are read from the settings.yaml file when the virtual
# environment is started. Applications variables can also be used in the
# settings.yaml file. However, these are replaced directly by the creator.
# Environment variables are resolved in the settings.yaml file as in the
# destination files only with the start of the virtual environment.
#
# Another important point is that Settings is executed with every start of the
# virtual environment and the target files are always reconfigured. For this to
# work, Settings creates copies with the target files as a template. The
# templates can be identified by the extended file extension _template. If no
# template exists, the one from the destination file will be created.
#
# The placeholders are generally case-insensitive and unknown ones are not
# replaced.
#
#     IMPORTANT
# THE FILE CONTAINS USEFUL EXAMPLE BUT MUST BE CUSTOMIZED.


# Settings defines the key-value pairs that can be further strutcurated, the
# placeholders are then fully qualified and without the 'settings' prefix.
# e.g. #[account]
settings:
    account:  $[USERNAME]
    password:


# List of files where placeholders are replaced.
