# Settings are a part of the initial startup of the virtual environment.
#
# The file system of the virtual environment is completely configured after
# creation. Settings is then an optional extension to further personalize this
# configuration. For this purpose, this file contains key-value pairs with a
# list of files in which the corresponding fully qualified placeholders are
# replaced, which is executed each time the virtual environment is started.
#
# Because only keys with a value are replaced, this file can be prepared with
# the creation of the virtual environment. The user enters his personal data
# and the specified files are personalized with the next start of the virtual
# environment.
#
# This file supports two types of placeholders for the creator #[...] and
# environment variables $[...] at runtime.
# Placeholders from the creator are filled with a value in this file.
# Dynamic placeholders of the environment variables are retained and are only
# resolved at runtime.
#
# In the destination files of the settings both forms of the variables can be
# used and so environment variables can be used directly.
# The names of the variables are case-insensitive.
#
#     IMPORTANT
# THE FILE CONTAINS USEFUL EXAMPLE BUT MUST BE CUSTOMIZED.


# Settings defines the key-value pairs that can be further strutcurated, the
# placeholders are then fully qualified and without the 'settings' prefix.
# e.g. #[account]
settings:
    account:  $[USERNAME]
    password:


# List of files where placeholders are replaced.
