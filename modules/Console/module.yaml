module:
    description: >
        Command line for the Portable Development Environment. It uses the
        environment variables from the virtual environment, including the PATH,
        and is therefore different from the Windows command line because it
        does not know the variables and path.
        In the module directory further extensions, scripts and tools can be
        added, which can then be used directly via the PATH.
