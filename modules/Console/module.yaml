module:
    description: >
        Command line for the virtual environment. It uses the environment
        variables from the virtual environment, including the PATH, and is
        therefore different from the Windows command line because it  does not
        know the variables and path.
        In the module directory further extensions, scripts and tools can be
        added, which can then be used directly via the PATH.
