        Proxy is not a visible module. The task is to pre-configure the
        virtual environment to use an HTTP/HTTPS proxy based on environment
        variables. The applications themselves may need to be configured
        directly if they cannot use HTTP_PROXY / HTTPS_PROXY / NO_PROXY
        automatically.
