        Proxy is not a visible module. The task is to pre-configure the
        Portable Development Environment to use an HTTP/HTTPS proxy based on
        environment variables. The applications themselves may need to be
        configured directly if they cannot use HTTP_PROXY / HTTPS_PROXY /
        NO_PROXY automatically.
