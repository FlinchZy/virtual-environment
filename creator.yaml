# Explanation of the properties
#
#     Workspace Environment vs. Environment
#     ----
# Workspace environment was needed if the project itself is already used in a
# virtual environment. Then environment-drive is already used. That is why
# another virtual drive is used as the workspace. During creation, it is
# important to understand that the scripts for creation use the drive and paths
# from the workspace environment and the configurations and scripts of the
# programs use the environment.
#
#     Modules
#     ----
# Modules contain installation instructions primarily in the form of 
# descriptions for automated installation on in the virtual environment. The
# installation can be based on downloads from the Internet and/or files and
# file structures contained in the module.
#
#     Extension of the modules
#     ----
# This file contains the collection of all modules. For each entry a
# corresponding module directory is expected, which contains the final
# assembly instructions as YAML file. New modules are simply added to the
# collection or unneeded ones are simply removed.
#
#     Syntax of the placeholders in the scripts
#     ----
# All properties can be used as placeholders with fully qualified name in the
# creator-scripts. Own/additional properties can be added here. The following
# case-insensitive syntax is used in the scripts: #[key]
# Unknown placeholders are not cleaned up.
#
#     boolean values
#     ----
# Supports: true/false on/off yes/no (case-insensitive)
# The values are normalized to true/false before use and used only as
# true/false (case-sensitive) in the scripts.
