# Explanation of the properties
#
#     boolean values
# Supports: true/false on/off yes/no (case insensitive)
# The values are normalized to true/false before use and used only as
# true/false (case sensitive) in the scripts.
#
#     Syntax of the placeholders in the scripts
# All properties can be used as placeholders with fully qualified name in the
# creator-scripts. Own/additional properties can be added here. The following
# case-insensitive syntax is used in the scripts: #[key]
# Unknown placeholders are not cleaned up.
#
#     workspace-drive vs. release-drive
# Workspace-drive was required when the project is used in a portable
# development environment. Then release-drive is already used.
#
#     Extension of the modules
# This file contains the collection of all modules. For each entry a
# corresponding module directory is expected, which contains the final assembly
# instructions as JavaScript file. New modules are simply added to the
# collection or unneeded ones are simply removed.
